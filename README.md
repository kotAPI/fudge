# Fudge
Fudge is a CSS framework to build any kind of project you want to. Mobiles, desktops, tablets- ANYTHING.

Test it Here - http://kotapi.github.io/fudge


#TODO

- Add grid for smallscreen devices and medium screens (phones and tablets, oh and tiny laptops)
- Animations similar to https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ with javascript support. For most commonly used html elements like buttons, text boxes, hyperlinks etc.
- Hamburger - support for collapsible navbar menu list on small screens. (We can call it Fudgeburger)
- Follow google guidelines for material design - https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html
- support for all the available html5 tags, ex- pre,sub,sup etc
- our very own parallax and gyro libraries (maybe in future, not urgent)
